# REPET_Python
REPET is a novel method for music/voice separation, by extraction of the underlying musical repeating structure proposed by Zafar RAFII and Bryan Pardo. Here is the Python Version of REPET.

Repetition is a fundamental element in generating and perceiving structure. In audio, mixtures are often composed of structures where a repeating background signal is superimposed with a varying foreground signal (e.g., a singer overlaying varying vocals on a repeating accompaniment or a varying speech signal mixed up with a repeating background noise). On this basis, we present the REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET), a simple approach for separating the repeating background from the non-repeating foreground in an audio mixture. The basic idea is to find the repeating elements in the mixture, derive the underlying repeating models, and extract the repeating background by comparing the models to the mixture. 

The Algorithm is Described in the REPET.pdf file
